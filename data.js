[00:12.68]I've been quiet aside you
[00:16.26]While my heart in my chest shouts
[00:23.27]Feeling silenced and lied to
[00:27.06]But enough is enough
[00:31.84]
[00:32.19]Now don't come find me, I won't be here waiting
[00:43.01]I so can do it alone, you're not worth staying
[00:53.91]
[00:55.39]Weren't listening me but now there's no way you won't hear
[01:00.72]There's a voice emerging in the night so loud and clear
[01:06.02]I'll turn it up like you turn me down, I'm not afraid
[01:10.75]Hit play, hit play
[01:13.43]It's the sound of walking away
[01:15.85]
[01:24.04]It's the sound of walking away
[01:34.64]It's the sound of walking away
[01:56.07]It's the sound of walking away
[01:58.49]
[01:59.41]I've been drowning inside you
[02:02.96]While my love it just pours out
[02:09.97]I've been running behind you
[02:13.77]But enough is enough
[02:18.39]
[02:18.95]Don't come find me, I won't be here waiting
[02:29.82]I so can do it alone, you're not worth staying
[02:40.98]
[02:42.13]Weren't listening but now there's no way you won't hear
[02:47.34]There's a voice emerging in the night so loud and clear
[02:52.57]I'll turn it up like you turn me down, I'm not afraid
[02:57.33]Hit play, hit play
[03:00.05]It's the sound of walking away
[03:02.44]
[03:10.69]It's the sound of walking away
[03:42.76]It's the sound of walking away
[03:45.18]
